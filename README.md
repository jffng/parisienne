## How this theme was developed

The following resources helped to become familiar with the concepts applied in this theme:

- [Block-based themes (Experimental)](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/themes/block-based-themes/)
- [Full Site Editing feature development in Gutenberg](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/labels/%5BFeature%5D%20Full%20Site%20Editing)
- [Theme starter content](https://roots.io/using-and-customizing-wordpress-starter-content/)

The steps to developing a theme using block templates with starter content are as follows: 

1. Developed block templates using the editor. 
2. Copy and paste those templates into static files in the `block-templates` 
3. Define the starter content for the site in `functions.php`
